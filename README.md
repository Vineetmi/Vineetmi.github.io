		how will they light the diya<br>
		the hungry famrmer of india will not be able to celebrate this festival diwali<br>
		the labour who are working on roads or in any other construction works.<br>
		their houswifes don't even know the festival of happiness<br>
		the true festival is for those whose houses are filled with black money<br>
		so in the arena of corruption Diwali is totally Diwala<br>
